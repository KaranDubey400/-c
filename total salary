Problem statement
Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -

    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.

Note for C++ users :

To round off the value , please include<cmath> library in the start of the program.
And round off the values in this way 
int ans = round(yourFinalValue);


code---- 
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std; 

int main(){
	int basicsalary;
	char grade;
	double allow;

	cin>>basicsalary>>grade;

	double hra = 0.2 *basicsalary;
	double da= 0.5 *basicsalary;
	double pf = 0.11 *basicsalary;

	if(grade=='A'){
		allow=1700;
	} else if (grade=='B'){
		allow=1500;
	}else{
		allow=1300;
	}
    
	double  totalsalary = (basicsalary +hra +da +allow -pf);
	int ans = round(totalsalary);
	cout<<ans;
}
